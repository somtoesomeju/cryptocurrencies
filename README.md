# cryptocurrencies

# Purpose
In this project, I am creating a portfolio that highlights various types of cyrptocurrencies that can be invested in the market. This report is carried out using unsupervised machine learning and the results are stored in a dataframe.

# Resources
- Software: Jupyter notebook 3.4.10
- Languages: Python

# Results
From the data, a dataframe is produced and edited to contain the three principal components needed for the machine learning alogrithm. Using the K-means model, a table is produced that predicts the cryptocurrency clusters. This data is visualized into a 3D scatter plot and a hyplot scatter plot. The purpose of this report is to visualize machine learning and this visualization is well seen in the model.
